# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

## üìå Overview
This project is a machine learning experiment focused on handwritten digit recognition using the **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier**. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, highlighting the importance of shuffling data before training. Additionally, the model is evaluated using **cross-validation and a confusion matrix**.

## üîç Key Features
- **Data Preparation**: Ensuring balanced representation of digits.
- **Train-Test Split**:
  - Manual split (to demonstrate data imbalance issues without shuffling).
  - Proper split using `train_test_split` with shuffling.
- **Model Training**:
  - Training an SGD classifier to recognize digit **'0'**.
  - Extending the model to recognize **all digits (0-9)**.
  - Performing **3-fold cross-validation**.
  - Evaluating performance using a **confusion matrix**.

## üìä Results & Insights
- Without shuffling, some digits (like 8 and 9) were missing from the training set, making it impossible for the model to learn them.
- After applying **train-test split with shuffle**, the dataset was balanced, and the model could learn all digits.
- **Confusion matrix** helped visualize classification accuracy and misclassified digits.
- **SGD classifier** is a fast, scalable method suitable for large-scale machine learning problems.
