# Breast Cancer Classification with SVM models

## üìå Overview  
This project demonstrates the application of **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** models for both classification and regression using real-world and synthetic datasets. It uses the `scikit-learn` library to train, evaluate, and visualize model performance under various preprocessing conditions, including feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning.

## üß≠ Introduction  
The project is divided into three main parts:

1. **Breast Cancer Classification** ‚Äì the core component of this project, where a linear SVM model is trained to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors.
2. **Iris Species Classification** ‚Äì BONUS: binary classification task that determines whether a flower belongs to the *Iris Virginica* species.
3. **SVM-based Regression** ‚Äì BONUS: section where both `LinearSVR` and `SVR` are used to perform polynomial regression on synthetically generated data.

Each section highlights different aspects of SVM models ‚Äî from linear classification and feature scaling to model complexity and hyperparameter tuning.

## üîç Key Features  
- **Classification with LinearSVC**:
  - Predicting **malignant vs. benign tumors** using selected features from the Breast Cancer dataset.
  - Recognizing **Iris Virginica** species vs. other species using petal dimensions.
- **Feature Scaling Impact**:
  - Comparison of model accuracy **with and without** feature normalization.
- **Regression with SVR**:
  - Fitting a 4th-degree polynomial using `LinearSVR` with polynomial features.
  - Comparing performance with standard `SVR` using a polynomial kernel.
- **Visualization**:
  - Plotting **decision boundaries** for classification tasks.
  - Plotting **regression curves** for SVR models.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - Using `GridSearchCV` to improve regression accuracy through optimal `C` and `coef0` selection.

## üìä Results  

### ‚úÖ Breast Cancer Classification:
This measurements are just illustrative results and might differ slightly:
- Without feature scaling:  
  - Training Accuracy: ~62%  
  - Testing Accuracy: ~68%
- With feature scaling:  
  - Training Accuracy: ~90%  
  - Testing Accuracy: ~90%
- ‚û§ **Conclusion**: Feature scaling significantly improves model performance for SVM classifiers.

### üå∏ Iris Virginica Classification (Bonus):
- Without feature scaling:  
  - Training Accuracy: ~96%  
  - Testing Accuracy: ~100%
- With feature scaling:  
  - Training Accuracy: ~95%  
  - Testing Accuracy: ~95% 
- ‚û§ Note: Scaling slightly reduced accuracy, likely due to features already being on similar scales.

### üìà Polynomial Regression with SVR (Bonus):
- `LinearSVR` with polynomial features achieved lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) than standard `SVR`.
- After hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`, `SVR` model performance improved significantly.

## üí° Why This Project  
Breast cancer remains one of the most common and life-threatening forms of cancer among women worldwide. Early and accurate detection significantly improves the chances of effective treatment and survival. This project demonstrates how **machine learning** ‚Äî specifically **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** ‚Äî can be applied to real-world medical data to aid in **automatic classification of tumors as malignant or benign**.  
By leveraging SVM models, we can support doctors and radiologists in making more informed decisions and reduce diagnostic errors.
