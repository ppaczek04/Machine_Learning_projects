# Machine_Learning_projects
This repository contains all the ML projects ive been currently working on, each directory contains a single project (in which you can find its own readme file).  

## 1. Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project is a machine learning experiment focused on handwritten digit recognition using the **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier**. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, highlighting the importance of shuffling data before training. Additionally, the model is evaluated using **cross-validation and a confusion matrix**.

## 2. Basic Regression Models With Noise

This project processes data with added noise and applies various regression models to it. The data is visualized on a scatter plot to evaluate model performance.
This project **helps understand the impact of noise on model accuracy and the importance of selecting appropriate regression techniques.**

## 3. Breast Cancer Classification with SVM models

This project demonstrates the application of **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** models for both classification and regression using real-world and synthetic datasets. It uses the `scikit-learn` library to train, evaluate, and visualize model performance under various preprocessing conditions, including feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning.

## 4. Decision Tree Classification and Regression
This project explores the use of **Decision Trees** for both classification and regression tasks. Decision Trees are easy to use and adapt well to data, making them an attractive choice for many machine learning problems. However, they are **prone to overfitting** â€” especially when the model becomes too complex. To address this, we regularize the model by tuning hyperparameters such as `max_depth` to ensure that the tree generalizes well on new, unseen data. 

## 5. Ensamble Learning and Random Forests - Democracy in ML
This project is a machine learning experiment focused on **ensemble learning** methods, particularly **Bagging**, **Random Forests**, and **Boosting**. The primary goal is to classify samples into different categories using various ensemble techniques, demonstrating how combining multiple weak models can lead to stronger and more reliable predictions compared to individual models.
