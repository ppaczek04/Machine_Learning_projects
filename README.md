# Machine_Learning_projects
This repository contains all the ML projects ive been currently working on, each directory contains a single project (in which you can find its own readme file).  

## 1. Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project is a machine learning experiment focused on handwritten digit recognition using the **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier**. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, highlighting the importance of shuffling data before training. Additionally, the model is evaluated using **cross-validation and a confusion matrix**.
