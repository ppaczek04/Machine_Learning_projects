# Data Dimensionality Reduction with PCA

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates how to reduce the dimensionality of datasets using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.  
We apply PCA to the **breast cancer** and **iris** datasets from scikit-learn, aiming to preserve at least **90% of the original data variance** while minimizing the number of features.

## üîç Key Features
- **Datasets**:
  - `breast_cancer`: 30 numerical features describing tumor properties.
  - `iris`: 4 numerical features describing flower dimensions.
- **StandardScaler**:
  - Applied before PCA to ensure all features contribute equally, regardless of their original scale.
- **PCA Analysis**:
  - Reduces the dimensionality of the data while preserving ‚â•90% variance.
  - Identifies how many components are needed to reach that threshold.
  - Extracts feature importance based on contribution to principal components.
- **Pickle Output**:
  - Saves explained variance ratios and sorted indices of original features based on importance.

## üìä Results & Insights

- PCA successfully reduced dimensionality while retaining **‚â•90% of the original variance** in both datasets.
- Applying `StandardScaler` before PCA was essential ‚Äî it ensured fair treatment of all features and improved the quality of the reduction.
- The analysis revealed which original features had the greatest influence on the principal components.
- Exporting the explained variance and ranked feature indices provides a foundation for further model optimization and interpretation.
- Overall, the reduced datasets are smaller, faster to process, and easier to visualize without losing essential information.
