    "In this exercise, we explored the power of **ensemble methods** like **Bagging** with **Decision Trees**. By utilizing different subsets of features and data for each tree, we were able to reduce variance and improve model generalization. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature selection**: The models showed that certain features (e.g., `worst area`, `mean texture`, `mean radius`) have a significant impact on prediction accuracy.\n",
    "- **Performance**: We observed that ensemble models outperformed individual decision trees by reducing overfitting and improving overall accuracy on the test set.\n",
    "  \n",
    "This approach demonstrates how combining multiple models with diverse perspectives can lead to more robust and reliable predictions, especially in complex tasks like tumor classification.\n"
