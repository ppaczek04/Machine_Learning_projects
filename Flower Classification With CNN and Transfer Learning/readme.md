# üåº Flower Classification with CNN and Transfer Learning

## üìå Overview  
This project demonstrates the use of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification, applied to the `tf_flowers` dataset.  
Two approaches are compared: a custom CNN trained from scratch and a model based on **transfer learning using the Xception architecture**.  
The project is implemented using **TensorFlow/Keras** and includes data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and result visualization.

## üß≠ Introduction  
The project is divided into two main sections:

1. **Custom CNN Model** ‚Äì A relatively simple convolutional network built and trained from scratch to classify flower images into five categories.
2. **Transfer Learning with Xception** ‚Äì An advanced approach using the Xception model pretrained on ImageNet. A custom classification head is added and trained in two stages: freezing the base model, then fine-tuning the full network.

Both models are trained and evaluated on the `tf_flowers` dataset using a standard split: 75% training, 15% validation, and 10% testing.

## üîç Key Features  
- **CNN from Scratch**:
  - Manual architecture with 3 convolutional blocks followed by dense layers.
  - Used as a baseline to evaluate performance without pretrained features.
- **Transfer Learning**:
  - Leveraging pretrained Xception weights as a feature extractor.
  - Two-phase training: frozen base + fine-tuning.
- **Data Pipeline**:
  - Efficient preprocessing using `tf.data.Dataset`: resizing, batching, shuffling, and normalization.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy measured on training, validation, and test sets.
  - Result comparison between baseline and transfer learning model.
- **Model Saving**:
  - Trained models saved as `.keras` files.
  - Accuracy scores stored using `pickle` for later use.

## üìä Results  

### ‚úÖ Custom CNN:
- Training Accuracy: ~96.8%  
- Validation Accuracy: ~65.1%  
- Test Accuracy: ~70.8%  
‚û§ Simple architecture, trained from scratch. Signs of overfitting are visible.

### ‚ö° Transfer Learning (Xception):
- Training Accuracy: ~98%  
- Validation Accuracy: ~88%  
- Test Accuracy: ~86%  
‚û§ Fast convergence and high performance thanks to pretrained feature extraction. Some mild overfitting remains but generalization improved significantly.

## üìí Why This Project  
This project highlights how deep learning and transfer learning techniques can be applied to **image classification tasks**, even with relatively limited data.
It compares the performance of a custom CNN versus a powerful pretrained model, showing the effectiveness of reusing learned visual features.
The approach used here can be extended to other domains where image classification is needed, such as medical imaging, agriculture, or manufacturing.
