# üß† Image Classification & Regression with Neural Networks in Keras

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates how to apply **neural networks using Keras and TensorFlow** to two key machine learning tasks:

1. **Image Classification** ‚Äì using the Fashion MNIST dataset.
2. **Regression** ‚Äì predicting California housing prices based on multiple input features.

The models are trained and evaluated using the `Sequential` API in Keras, and their performance is visualized using **TensorBoard**. We also explore how different model architectures impact training outcomes.

## üß≠ Project Structure

1. **Image Classification** (Fashion MNIST):
   - Normalize image data to `[0, 1]`
   - Build a 3-layer dense neural network
   - Train and validate with `TensorBoard` logging
   - Save trained model to `fashion_clf.keras`

2. **Regression Task** (California Housing Dataset):
   - Load and split data into training, validation, and test sets
   - Normalize features using a `Normalization` layer
   - Train multiple models with different architectures:
     - 100/50/20
     - 20/50/100
     - 50/50/50
   - Use `EarlyStopping` to prevent overfitting
   - Visualize training in TensorBoard
   - Save models as `reg_housing_1.keras`, `reg_housing_2.keras`, etc.

## üìä Results Overview

### üß• Fashion MNIST Classification

- Trained with 3 dense layers (300 ‚Üí 100 ‚Üí 10 softmax)
- Training accuracy: ~90%
- Validation accuracy: ~88‚Äì89%
- ‚û§ **Conclusion:** The model generalizes well with minimal overfitting.

### üè† California Housing Regression

| Architecture     | Epochs (Early Stopping) | Final Validation RMSE |
|------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| 100 ‚Üí 50 ‚Üí 20     | ~12                      | ~0.555                 |
| 20 ‚Üí 50 ‚Üí 100     | ~19                      | ~0.559                 |
| 50 ‚Üí 50 ‚Üí 50      | ~15                      | ~0.554                 |

- ‚û§ **Conclusion:** All architectures performed similarly in terms of RMSE,  
  but the 100/50/20 model converged the fastest and showed more stable learning curves.  
  Balanced structures like 50/50/50 also proved reliable and efficient.


## üí° Why This Project

This project is designed to provide practical, hands-on experience with deep learning using the **Keras API** within **TensorFlow**.  
It serves as a foundation for understanding how to build and tune neural networks for both **classification** and **regression** tasks.

Key learning goals:
- Understand the structure and training of **Sequential models**
- Apply **data normalization**, **callbacks**, and **TensorBoard**
- Explore how **model architecture** affects training performance
- Learn how to **evaluate and compare** models using validation metrics

By working with real datasets like **Fashion MNIST** and **California Housing**, this project simulates common machine learning workflows used in image analysis and predictive modeling.
